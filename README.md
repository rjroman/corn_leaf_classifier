Image Classifier Web Application using Flask

This repository contains the code for an image classifier web application built using Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python, and PyTorch, a deep learning framework. The application uses a pre-trained ResNet18 model for image classification tasks.

Key Features:

User-friendly Interface: Upload an image through the web interface to get real-time predictions.
State-of-the-Art Model: Utilizes a ResNet18 model trained on a large dataset for accurate image classification.
Efficient Deployment: Easy to deploy on local machines or cloud platforms for quick testing and deployment.
How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Flask application using python app.py.
Access the web interface via a web browser and upload an image for classification.
Dependencies:

Flask
PyTorch
torchvision
NumPy
Pillow
